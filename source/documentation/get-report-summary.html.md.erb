# Get report summary

After you submit a monthly report, HMRC processes the data and generates a results summary, which provides high-level information about the submission.

You can access a results summary only after the reporting window closes.

Call the [Get report summary](http://p) endpoint to find out whether the results summary is available for a submitted report.

To check the availability of a results summary, provide:

- the Z-Reference
- the tax year 
- the report month
- the correct `Accept` and `Authorization` headers

If the request is successful, the response includes:

- a URL to retrieve the results summary
- pagination details, including total records and total pages

If the results summary is not yet available or the report is not found, the API returns a `404 Not Found` response.
