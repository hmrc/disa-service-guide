# Get started with the API

To use the ISA Returns API, you must register an application in the [HMRC Developer Hub](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/), request access to the API, and configure authentication.

You must first integrate and test your software in the sandbox before requesting production access.

Follow the steps below to get started.

## Create a Developer Hub account

You need a Developer Hub account to register and manage your applications. If you do not already have one, [register for an account](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/developer/registration) before continuing.

## Register your application for sandbox testing

Register a sandbox application in the Developer Hub. This generates a client ID and secret for use in the sandbox environment.

You will use this application to:

- subscribe to the sandbox version of the API
- test integration and validate your request and response handling
- simulate submission flows using test users

Use the sandbox base URL in your application:
[https://test-api.service.hmrc.gov.uk](https://test-api.service.hmrc.gov.uk).

You must also create one or more test Government Gateway user IDs to authenticate against user-restricted endpoints. These can be created in the Developer Hub.

For more information, see [Testing in the sandbox](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/testing).

## Request access to API

The ISA Returns API is a restricted-access API. Its endpoints are visible only to authorised and subscribed applications. Because it is a restricted-access API, you must request access before you can subscribe your application.

To request access, you must:

- be an employee of an organisation listed on the [ISA manager register (GOV.UK)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-individual-savings-account-isa-managers-approved-by-hmrc/registered-individual-savings-account-isa-managers) or
- be part of a third-party organisation with an existing relationship with a listed ISA manager
- have a Developer Hub account with a registered software application

If you are an ISA manager and your organisation is not listed on the register, please check [how to apply for ISA manager status (GOV.UK)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-to-be-an-isa-manager).

If you are a third-party organisation, HMRC may ask you to provide evidence of your organisation's relationship with the ISA manager to confirm eligibility.

If you do not have a Developer Hub account, you can [register for an account on GOV.UK](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/developer/registration). The account must use a work email address.

Once your Developer Hub account and software application are set up:

1. [Sign in to Developer Hub](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/developer/login).
2. Go to the ISA Returns API landing page.
3. Go to the Endpoints section and select 'Request access'.
4. Fill in the request form with:
    - your organisation name
    - the API name: ISA Returns
    - the application ID linked to your Developer Hub software application

HMRC may contact you to discuss your request and confirm eligibility.

If you are not signed in, or access has not yet been granted, the Endpoints section will not display a link. You may see 'Not applicable' or 'Request access' instead.

## Subscribe your application to API

If your access is approved, you will receive a confirmation email, and your software application will be subscribed to the API.

If you are not familiar with subscriptions or API visibility, see the [Reference guide](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/reference-guide#api-access).

## Configure authentication

The ISA Returns API uses OAuth 2.0 with user-restricted scopes. In the sandbox environment, you must:

- create a test Government Gateway user ID in the Developer Hub
- use the OAuth 2.0 grant flow to obtain a test access token
- include the token in the Authorization header of each request to the API

Tokens expire after 4 hours and must then be refreshed.

Test failure scenarios such as a user not granting authority during the OAuth flow. This ensures your application handles all outcomes correctly.

For full guidance, see the [Authorisation](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/authorisation) guide.

## Start using API in production

When your integration is complete and you are ready to go live:

- register a new production application in the Developer Hub
- request access to ISA Returns API v1.0 in the production environment
- subscribe your production application to the API

Each production application receives its own client ID and credentials.

For guidance on production access, see the [Getting started](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/using-the-hub) guide.

Use the production base URL:
[https://api.service.hmrc.gov.uk](https://api.service.hmrc.gov.uk).

When your application is in production, you must submit reports each month using the same process.

Support for ongoing use follows standard HMRC practices for APIs. Any future changes to the ISA Returns service will be communicated by the Software Developer Support Team.

## Use the correct headers

All API requests must include:

- an `Accept` header to specify the API version (for example, `application/vnd.hmrc.1.0+json`)
- a valid `Authorization` header with your bearer token

Each API call must include the Z-Reference assigned to the ISA manager.
