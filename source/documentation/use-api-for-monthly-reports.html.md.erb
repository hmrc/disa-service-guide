# Use the API for monthly reports

Learn how the ISA Returns API fits into the monthly reporting cycle and which endpoints to use at each stage.

## Connect the API to monthly cycle

This diagram shows how ISA managers or third parties use application software to prepare, submit, and review monthly reconciliation results. The software connects to the ISA Returns API to send data to HMRC and retrieve reconciliation results.

## Check which API endpoints to use

When you use the API, you must call different endpoints at each stage of the reporting process.

This table shows which call to make at each step.

| Step                                 | Action                            | Endpoint                           |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Submit monthly report data           | Upload a batch of account records | `POST /monthly/{zReference}/{taxYear}/{month}` |
| Declare monthly report as complete   | Confirm that all data for a monthly report has been submitted, and thus trigger reconciliation and processing after reporting window closes | `POST /monthly/{zReference}/{taxYear}/{month}/declaration` |
| Get report summary                   | Find out whether the results summary is available for a submitted report | `GET /monthly/{zReference}/{taxYear}/{month}/results/summary` |
